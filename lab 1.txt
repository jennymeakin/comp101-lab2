Hi there, my name is Jennifer Meakin but i go by jenny. i am 19 years old and want to major in psychology to eventually do occupational therapy. I speak two languages, Spanish being my first and English second. I love being outdoors whether it's hiking or taking a walk or going for a dip in the ocean. when i get stressed i find baking super peaceful and also enjoy spending time with my friends.
